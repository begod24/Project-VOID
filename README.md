# VOID

> **Cooperative third-person horror shooter**  
> Descend into total darkness with your squad—armed, special night-vision goggles and a motion tracker. Hunt or be hunted by relentless shadow-monsters that lurk beyond the light.

## 🌑 Game Concept

In the quarantined depths of an already abandoned facilities, labs and etc, light is your only ally. Without it, the shadow-monsters move unseen, relentless and unknowable. Only by carefully managing your battery-powered NVD, and scanning the environment with a motion tracker can you survive—and uncover the facility’s dark secret.

## 🔦 Key Pillars

1. **Darkness as Threat**  
   Every corner is pitch black. Your NVD is precious resources—use them sparingly.

2. **Shadow-Monsters**  
   Uncounted, amorphous entities that react to light and sound. You’ll never know how many are watching.

3. **Tactical Co-op**  
   Coordinate with two teammates: share batteries, cover blind spots, and watch each other’s backs.

4. **Gadgets & Gear**   
   - **NVD(Night-Vision-Device)**: monochrome vision in complete dark  
   - **Motion Tracker**: pulsating UI indicator of nearby movement  

5. **Sci-fi Firearms**  
   Modular weapons with distinct recoil patterns and VFX—rechargeable energy cells power every shot.

6. **Emergent Tension**  
   Minimal HUD, no ammo counters on screen—listen for rustles, watch your light, and trust your locator.

## 🎮 Core Mechanics

- **Third-Person Over-the-Shoulder**  
  Fluid movement, shoulder-swapping camera, aim-down-sights zoom.

- **Light & Vision Systems** 
  - **Night-vision goggles** toggle for deep-dark exploration  
  - **Motion Tracker** pulses stronger as shadow-monsters approach  

- **Combat & Stealth**  
  - Energy-based weapons with reload animations and recoil  
  - Use silence and darkness against your enemies—fight only when necessary  

- **Resource Management**  
  Batteries, energy cells and locator charges are scarce—plan every encounter.

- **Environmental Puzzles**  
  Terminal hacks, manual overrides and sealed doors block your path—teamwork is essential.

## 🎨 Visual & Audio Style

- **Look:** Dark, industrial corridors reminiscent of subterranean quarantine zones—only emergency lights break the gloom.  
- **VFX:** Ethereal particle effects inspired by *Prey* and *GTFO*, emphasizing void-like distortions.  
- **Audio:** Deep tunnel reverb, distant echoes, and unsettling ambient whispers—sound is as critical as sight.

## 🗺️ Roadmap Highlights

- **Phase 1:** Greybox prototyping—light, vision, single shadow-monster AI  
- **Phase 2:** Core combat loop—flashlight+NV, motion locator, basic weapons  
- **Phase 3:** Full vertical slice—puzzle terminal, branching dialogue, co-op sync  
- **Phase 4:** Content expansion—new rooms, shadow-monster behaviors, advanced VFX  
- **Phase 5:** Polish & tension tuning—balance battery life, audio-visual chills, final art pass
